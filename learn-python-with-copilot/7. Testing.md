# Learn Python with GitHub Copilot - Lab 4: Unit Test the Code with GitHub Copilot

## Objective
Use Copilot to test your project code
  - Jane now wants to use Copilot to generate test suggestions, test cases, setup and teardown methods, mock objects, and exception tests for her project code.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Open the relevant file 
Open `unit-test-lab.py` in VS Code located in the python-intermediate folder - we will use this file to complete this lab

---
### Task 1: Test Suggestions

Jane now wants to use Copilot to generate test suggestions to test the functions in her code. She wants to create unit tests based on these test suggestions later.

Test suggestions in Python are suggestions for tests that can be generated automatically by a testing framework ACor a tool like Copilot. These suggestions are based on the code that you have written and can help you to identify potential issues or edge cases that you may have missed.

You can use Copilot to generate test suggestions by following these steps:

1. Place the cursor where you want to generate the test suggestion. Here we will create a new line at the bottom of the file and place them there.
2. Type `# Test suggestion:` and press enter.
3. Type a brief description of the test that you want to generate - It should look something like this: `# Test suggestion: Test that a task with no project is added to the General project`
4. Press enter and Copilot will generate the code for the test suggestion.
Note - If Copilot does not generate to test suggestions, type `class TestTask(unittest.TestCase)` under the test suggestion line and code should appear.

Sample Code:
```python
import unittest

class TestTask(unittest.TestCase):

    # Test suggestion: Test that a task with no project is added to the General project
    def test_task_with_no_project_is_added_to_general(self):
        task = Task('Test Task')
        self.assertEqual(task.project, projects.get('General', Project('General')))
```

### Task 2: Test Case Generation 

Jane now wants to generate test cases using two different popular testing frameworks to ensure that her code is working as expected: 

In Python, a test case is an individual unit of testing which checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs. PyUnit(Unittest) and PyTest are popular testing frameworks in Python.
PyTest is one of the most widely used Python testing frameworks. It is open-source and supports Unit testing, functional testing, and API tests.

You can use Copilot to generate unit tests for the `add_tasks` function using pytest by following these steps:

1. Open terminal by clicking the terminal button on the top, to the left of the search bar. 
2. In the terminal, type "pip install pytest". If you get a command not found error, type "pip3 install pytest".
3. Place the cursor where you want to generate the unit tests. In this case, we will generate them on a new line at the bottom of the file.
4. Type `#` use pytest to generate tests for the `add_tasks` function. Press Enter.
5. Start typing `@pytest.mark.parametrize("project_name, expected", [`
6. Copilot will generate the code for the parameterized test.
7. Replace the sample test data with your own test data.
8. Repeat steps 3-5 for each set of test data.

Sample code:
```python
    # Use Pytest to generate test for the add_task method in the Project class
    @pytest.mark.parametrize('task_description', [
        'Task 1',
        'Task 2'])
    def test_add_task(task_description):
        project = Project('Project 1')
        task = Task(task_description, project)
        assert (task in project.tasks)
```
PyUnit is a built-in unit testing framework in Python. The primary goal of PyUnit is to facilitate the creation of test cases and test suites to verify the behavior and correctness of individual units of code. 

You can use Copilot to generate unit tests for the `remove_task` function using PyUnit by following these steps:

1. Place the cursor where you want to generate the unit tests. In this case, we will generate them on a new line at the bottom of the file.
2. Type `# use unittest to generate tests for the remove_task function`.
3. Press enter.
4. Type class TestProject(unittest.TestCase):.
5. Copilot will generate the code for the test class.
6. If test suggestions did not appear, place the cursor inside the test class.
7. Type def `test_remove_task(self):`.
8. Copilot will generate the code for the test method.
9. Replace the sample test data with your own test data.
10. Repeat steps 6-8 for each set of test data.

Sample code:

```python
# use unittest to generate tests for the remove_task method in the Project class
class TestProject(unittest.TestCase):
    # Test suggestion: Test that a task is removed from the project
    def test_remove_task(self):
        project = Project('Project 1')
        task = Task('Task 1', project)
        project.remove_task(task)
        self.assertNotIn(task, project.tasks)
```
### Task 3: Setup and Teardown 
Jane now wants to create a setup and teardown method for her remove task function: 

With unittest, you can define setup and teardown methods within test cases. These fixture methods, such as setUp() and tearDown(), allow you to set up the necessary environment before executing each test and clean up any resources afterward.

In this section we will use Copilot to define setup and teardown methods within test cases by following these steps:

1. Copy the following code to the bottom of the file.
```python
#use unittest to generate tests for the remove_task function
class TestProject2(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_remove_task(self):
        self.project.remove_task(self.task)
        self.assertEqual(len(self.project.tasks), 2)
        self.project.remove_task(self.task2)
        self.assertEqual(len(self.project.tasks), 1)
        self.project.remove_task(self.task3)
        self.assertEqual(len(self.project.tasks), 0)
```
2. Place cursor above the test_remove_task function and type def setUp(self):.
3. Copilot will generate the code for the setup method.
4. Place the cursor below the test_remove_task function code.
5. Type def tearDown(self): .
6. Copilot will generate the code for the teardown method.

Sample code:
```python
import unittest

#use unittest to generate tests for the remove_task function
class TestProject2(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.project = Project("Project 1")
        self.task = Task("Test task", self.project)
        self.task2 = Task("Test task 2", self.project)
        self.task3 = Task("Test task 3", self.project)

    def test_remove_task(self):
        self.project.remove_task(self.task)
        self.assertEqual(len(self.project.tasks), 2)
        self.project.remove_task(self.task2)
        self.assertEqual(len(self.project.tasks), 1)
        self.project.remove_task(self.task3)
        self.assertEqual(len(self.project.tasks), 0)

    def tearDown(self) -> None:
        return super().tearDown()
```

### Task 4: Mocking 

Jane wants to use mocking to test one of the functions in isolation:

In unit testing, mocking is a technique used to simulate the behavior of objects that a piece of code depends on. It is often necessary to test a piece of code in isolation, without relying on other parts of the system. However, some code may depend on external objects or services that are not available during testing, or that may have unpredictable behavior.

Mocking allows you to create a "fake" object that behaves in the same way as the real object, but that can be controlled and manipulated during testing. This allows you to test your code in isolation, without relying on external objects or services. 


You can use Copilot to generate mock objects for testing by following these steps:

1. At the bottom of the code file copy and paste the following code:
```python
#use magic mock object to generate tests for the remove_task function
class TestProject3(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_remove_task(self):
```
2. below the test_`remove_task` function, type `#Create a mock object for the project class using magic mock and populate the tasks list with mock tasks`
3. Copilot will generate the code for the mock object and populate the task variable. If it doesn't generate the code to populate the task variable, press enter and start typing project.tasks and it should complete it.
4. Below the generated code, type: #use the mock object to test the remove_task function.
5. Copilot will generate tests using the mock object. 

Sample code:
```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

#use magic mock object to generate tests for the remove_task function
class TestProject3(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_remove_task(self):
    #Create a mock object for the project class using magic mock and populate the tasks list with mock tasks
        project = MagicMock()
        project.tasks = [MagicMock(), MagicMock(), MagicMock()]
        task = MagicMock()
        project.remove_task(task)
        #Check if the task was removed from the project
        self.assertNotIn(task, project.tasks)
```

---
### Task 5: Exception Testing 

Now Jane wants to test that the Exception thrown in the add_task function works as expected: 

Exception testing is a technique used in unit testing to verify that a piece of code raises the expected exceptions under certain conditions. The purpose of exception testing is to ensure that your code handles errors and unexpected situations correctly, and that it fails gracefully when necessary.

You can use Copilot to generate exception tests by following these steps:

1. Add the following code at the end of the file:
```python
# test that the valueerror in the add_task method is raised
class TestProject4(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_exception_raised(self):
```
2. If copilot does not generate suggestions, type def test_exception_raised(self):.
3. Copilot will generate the code for the exception test.

Sample Code:

```python
# test that the valueerror in the add_task method is raised
class TestProject4(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_exception_raised(self):
        project = Project("Project 1")
        task = Task("Task 1", project)
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
         project.remove_task(Task("Task 2"))
```
If you want to test for an Exception, you can use `with self.assertRaises(Exception):.`

## Summary
In this lab, we learned how to use Copilot to generate test suggestions, test cases, setup and teardown methods, mock objects, and exception tests for our project code. We also learned how to use PyUnit and PyTest to generate unit tests for our code.
