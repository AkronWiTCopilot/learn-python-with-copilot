# Learn Python with GitHub Copilot - Lab 2: Develop Code with Python Using GitHub Copilot 

## Objective
Use Copilot to develop the project management application.  
- Jane is now ready to develop her project management application with the help of Github Copilot.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Designing the Project Class 
With the basics in place, Jane starts to develop the Project class. She creates a new file in Visual Studio Code named `project.py` and writes:

``` python
class Project
```

As she writes, Copilot assists by suggesting the attributes and the `init` method. Jane presses the Tab key to accept the suggestion, and Copilot completes the class definition and the `init` method.


``` python
class Project:
    """
    Represents a user's project to categorize tasks.
    
    Attributes:
    - name (str): Name of the project.
    - tasks (list): List of tasks associated with this project.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.tasks = []
```

Jane appreciates the assistance, learning the purpose and structure of the `init` function. The `init` function initializes the class objects's attributes. The `self` parameter refers to the object itself, and the `name` parameter is the name of the project. The `tasks` attribute is a list that will store the tasks associated with the project.

---
### Task 2: Developing Methods for Task Management:
Jane's second task is: `Develop methods to add, view, and remove tasks within a project.`

Beginning with the `add` method, Jane writes:

```python
    def add_tasks
```

Copilot provides guidance, which she uses to craft the `add_tasks method`. Following a similar learning process, she then creates methods to view, remove, and clear tasks, with Copilot ensuring she's applying Python best practices.

As Jane types her methods, Copilot provides suggestions for the method names and parameters. Soon, she has a complete Project class with methods to add, view, remove, and clear tasks.

```python
class Project:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.tasks = []

    # def add_task
    def add_task(self, task):
        self.tasks.append(task) 

    # def view_tasks
    def view_tasks(self):
        return self.tasks

    # def remove_task
    def remove_task(self, task):
        self.tasks.remove(task)

    # def clear_tasks
    def clear_tasks(self):
        self.tasks = []
```

Jane would like to practice her newly created class. Below her class definition, she writes a few lines of code to manually test her methods.

```python
# Create a new project
project = Project("Project 1")

#add tasks to the project
project.add_task("Task 1")
project.add_task("Task 2")

#view tasks in the project
tasks = project.view_tasks()
print(tasks)
```

She runs the code and sees the tasks displayed in the console. 
```console
> Task 1
> Task 2
```
---
### Task 3: Handling Uncategorized Tasks:
Jane third task is: `Ensure tasks without a project are categorized under "General`.

This means that tasks may be created outside of the Project class. She realizes that a `Task` class is needed to represent tasks and their associated projects. Under her Project class, she writes:

```python
class Task:

    def __init__(self, description, project):
        self.description = description
        self.project = project

    def view_task(self):
        return self.description
    
    def view_project(self):
        return self.project
```

Her `Task` class has an `init` method that initializes the task's attributes. The `description` parameter is the task's description, and the `project` parameter is the project the task is associated with. She also writes methods to view the task and its associated project.

Jane needs to handle tasks without a project, but her current Task class requires that a project is given upon creation. She asks Copilot for assistance:

> How can I create an init function with an optional parameter in Python?

Copilot responds:

> In Python, you can create an `__init__` function with an  optional parameter by providing a default value for the parameter in the function definition. Here's an example:
> 
> ```python
> class MyClass:
>     def __init__(self, param1, param2=None):
>         self.param1 = param1
>         self.param2 = param2 if param2 is not None else > "default value"
> ```
> 
> In this example, `param2` is an optional parameter. If you create an instance of `MyClass` without providing a second argument, `param2` will be set to `"default value"`.

Jane updates her code to include a default value for the `project` parameter in the `Task` class's `init` method.

```python
 class Task:

    def __init__(self, description, project=None):
        self.description = description
        if project is None:
            self.project = Project("General")
            task.project.add_task(self)
        else:
            self.project = project
```

This change allows tasks to be created without a project. If a project is not provided, then a default project named "General" is created. The task is then added to the "General" project.

She tests this change manually by adding a few lines of code outside of her class definition.

```python
# Create a task with a project
project1 = Project("Project 1")
task = Task("Task 1", project1)
print( task.view_task())
print(task.view_project())

# Create a task without a project
task2 = Task("Task 2")
print(task2.view_task())
print(task2.view_project())
```

Running this prints the following to the console:

```console
> Task 1
> Project 1
> Task 2
> General
```

Jane is happy with the output.

However, a possible bug arises. She needs make sure that there isn't an existing "General" project before creating a new one. She decides to add a global dictionary to keep a record of all the created projects which she can check against before creating a new General project. She adds a dictionary called `projects` to the top of her `project.py` file.

```python
projects = {}
```
She asks Copilot to provide information on the best way to retrieve a value from a dictionary in Python. Using Copilot's suggestion, she adds the following to her Task `init` method:

```python
class Task:

    def __init__(self, description, project=None):
        self.description = description
        if project is None:
            self.project = projects.get('General', Project('General'))
            task.project.add_task(self)
        else:
            self.project = project
```
The `get` method retrieves the value associated with the key `'General'` from the `projects` dictionary. If the key does not exist, the `get` method returns the default value, which is a new `Project` object with the name "General". The task is then added to the "General" project.

Jane then updates the Project `init` method to add every new project to the `projects` dictionary.

```python
 def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.tasks = []
        projects.setdefault(name, self)
```

The `setdefault` method adds the project to the `projects` dictionary if it does not already exist. If the project already exists, the `setdefault` method does nothing.

She manually tests her changes by adding a few lines of code outside of her class definition.

```python
# Create a task with a project
project1 = Project("Project 1")
task = Task("Task 1", project1)

# Create a task without a project
task2 = Task("Task 2")
task3 = Task("Task 3")

# print all projects and their tasks
for project in projects.values():
    print(f"Project: {project.name}")
    for task in project.view_tasks():
        print(f"Task: {task.view_task()}")
```

Running this prints the following to the console:

```console
> Project: Project 1
> Task: Task 1
> Project: General
> Task: Task 2
> Task: Task 3
```

Jane's updated `project.py` file looks like this:

```python
projects = {}

class Project:
    """
    Represents a project containing tasks.
    
    Attributes:
    - name (str): Name of the project.
    - tasks (list): List of tasks in the project.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.tasks = []
        projects.setdefault(name, self)

    def add_task(self, task):
        self.tasks.append(task)

    #return all tasks in the project
    def view_tasks(self):
       return self.tasks

    def remove_task(self, task):
        self.tasks.remove(task)

    def clear_tasks(self):
        self.tasks = []


class Task:

    def __init__(self, description, project=None):
        self.description = description
        if project is None:
            self.project = projects.get('General', Project('General'))
        else:
            self.project = project
        self.project.add_task(self)

    def view_task(self):
        return self.description
    
    def view_project(self):
        return self.project.name
    

# Create a task with a project
project1 = Project("Project 1")
task = Task("Task 1", project1)

# Create a task without a project
task2 = Task("Task 2")
task3 = Task("Task 3")

# print all projects and their tasks
for project in projects.values():
    print(f"Project: {project.name}")
    for task in project.view_tasks():
        print(f"Task: {task.view_task()}")
```
