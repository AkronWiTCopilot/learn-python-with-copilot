# Learn Python with GitHub Copilot

## Background:
Jane Mitchell is a budding developer in the "TaskMaster Pro" team, a Python-based web application aimed at helping professionals manage their tasks. Despite her enthusiasm and background in other languages, Jane's experience with Python is at the beginner level. The team, aware of her situation, assigns her a user story with related tasks, considering it an excellent opportunity for her to both learn and contribute.

User Story assigned to Jane: 
### "As a user, I want to be able to categorize my tasks by project so that I can better organize my workflow."

#### Tasks:

- Create a class named `Project` to represent a user's project.
- Develop methods to add, view, and remove tasks within a project.
- Ensure tasks without a project are categorized under "General".

## Learning Relevant Python Concepts:
Before diving into development, Jane decides to understand relevant Python concepts that would be crucial for her tasks. Using GitHub Copilot, she starts by typing:

`How do you create a class in Python?`

Copilot provides an example, helping Jane understand the structure and syntax. She repeats this process for methods, attributes, and other foundational OOP concepts in Python.


## Designing the Project Class:
With the basics in place, Jane starts to develop the Project class. As she writes:


`class Project:`

Copilot assists:


```python
class Project:
    """
    Represents a user's project to categorize tasks.
    
    Attributes:
    - name (str): Name of the project.
    - tasks (list): List of tasks associated with this project.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.tasks = []
```

Jane appreciates the assistance, learning the purpose and structure of the __init__ method.

## Developing Methods for Task Management:
For her second task, Jane types:

`How to add an item to a list in Python?`

Copilot provides guidance, which she uses to craft the add_task method. Following a similar learning process, she then creates methods to view and remove tasks, with Copilot ensuring she's applying Python best practices.

## Handling Uncategorized Tasks:
Jane recalls the requirement about tasks without a project. Using Copilot, she learns about default parameters and applies this knowledge to handle tasks that aren't assigned to a specific project, defaulting them to "General".

## Unit Testing and Validation:
Aware of the importance of testing but unfamiliar with it in Python, Jane types:

`How to write unit tests in Python?`

Copilot offers guidance on Python's unittest framework. Using this, Jane writes tests for her Project class and its methods, validating her code and learning about testing paradigms in Python.

## Code Review and Iteration:
After committing her changes, Jane raises a pull request. During the code review, her teammates provide feedback. Whenever she's unsure about how to implement a suggested change, she turns to Copilot. It not only provides solutions but reinforces her understanding of Python, making every code review comment a learning opportunity.

## Reflection:
Through this user story and the tasks associated with it, Jane's journey with GitHub Copilot becomes twofold: successfully executing her tasks while significantly enhancing her Python skills. The continuous feedback loop with Copilot ensures she learns effectively, evolving from a beginner to a more confident Python developer by the end of her assignment.
