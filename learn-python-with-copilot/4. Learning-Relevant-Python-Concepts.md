# Learn Python with GitHub Copilot - Lab 1: Learn Python with GitHub Copilot

##  Objective
Utilize GitHub Copilot Chat to learn programming concepts in Python.  

- Jane uses Github Copilot to learn Python.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Open Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code
We will use Visual Studio Code with the GitHub Copilot Chat Extension for this lab. Open Visual Studio Code and verify that Copilot is active by clicking on the icon near the bottom right of VS Code:  
<img src=".attachments/vscode-copilot-status-icon.png" alt="vscode-copilot-chat-status-icon" width="35" />  
A dropdown will appear on the top menu displaying the status:
<img src=".attachments/vscode-copilot-status.png" alt="vscode-copilot-chat-status" width="600" />  

Verify the Copilot Chat icon appears in the Left-side menu:  
<img src=".attachments/vscode-copilot-chat-icon.png" alt="vscode-copilot-chat-icon" width="35" />  
*If you don't see the Copilot Chat icon, make sure you have followed all of the steps in the [Prerequities](./3.%20Prerequisites.md).*

### Task 1: Learning Relevant Python Concepts 

Copilot Chat helps Jane learn the basic syntax of Python. By asking questions and using the prompts provided by Copilot, Jane will learn how to create a Python file in Visual Studio Code, write Python statements, and run her Python file.

**Follow along with Jane on her journey by copying her actions within Visual Studio Code.**

Jane opens Visual Studio Code and clicks on the Copilot Chat icon <img src=".attachments/vscode-copilot-chat-icon.png" alt="vscode-copilot-chat-icon" width="20" /> located on the left menu.

She types the below query and presses the `Enter` button:
> *What are the basic syntax rules in Python?*

<img src=".attachments/vscode-copilot-chat-window.png" alt="copilot-chat-window" width="400" />  

Copilot responds with a list of basic syntax rules, including how statements and comments are written, how to use indentation to define blocks of code, and the role of parentheses in Python.

**Note: Copilot responses may vary due to the generative algorithm*

> Python has several basic syntax rules that must be followed in order to write valid code. Here are some of the most important ones:
>
> - Statements must be written on separate lines
> - Indentation is used to indicate blocks of code
> - Comments start with the # symbol and continue to the end of the line
> - Variables are assigned using the = operator
> - Strings are enclosed in either single or double quotes
>
> Do you have any specific questions about these rules?

It then provides a prompt that Jane can click on to view examples of Python statements.  

<img src=".attachments/vscode-copilot-suggestion.png" alt="vscode-copilot-suggestion" width="300" />  

Jane clicks on the prompt provided by Copilot and sees the following response:

> Here are some examples of Python statements:
> 
> - `print("Hello, world!")` - prints the string "Hello, world!" to the console
>
> - `x = 5` - assigns the value 5 to the variable x
>
> - `if x > 0:` - starts an if statement that checks if x is greater than 0
>
> - `for i in range(10):` - starts a for loop that iterates over the numbers 0 through 9
>
> - `return x` - returns the value of x from a function
> 
> Do you need more examples or do you have any questions about these statements?

Jane wants to practice writing Python statements and so she asks Copilot:

> *How can I create a python file in VSCode?*

 Copilot responds:
> 1. Open Visual Studio Code.
> 2. Click on the Explorer icon on the side menu or use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + E to open the Explorer sidebar.
> 3. Click on the New File icon at the top of the Explorer sidebar or right-click in the Explorer sidebar and select New File.
> 4. Enter the file name with a .py extension, for example, practice.py.
> 5. Press Enter to create the file. The new file will open in the editor.
> 
> Now you can start writing your Python statements in this file.

Following Copilot's instructions, she opens a new file in VS Code and saves it as `practice.py`. She starts by writing a simple print statement from the examples above: `print`. As she write, Copilot provides suggestions for completing the statement. She selects the first suggestion and presses `Enter` to complete the statement.

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
This statement prints the string "Hello, world!" to the console.

She then writes a simple variable assignment statement: `x =`. Copilot provides suggestions for completing the statement. She selects the first suggestion and presses `Enter` to complete the statement. 

```python
x = 5
```
This statement assigns the value 5 to the variable x.

She then writes a simple if statement: `if x > 0:`. Copilot provides suggestions for completing the statement. She selects the first suggestion and presses `Enter` to complete the statement. 

```python
if x == 5:
    print("x is 5.")
```
If x is equal to 5, the statement prints "x is 5." to the console.

She then writes a simple for loop: `for i in range(10):`. Copilot provides suggestions for completing the statement. She selects the first suggestion and presses `Enter` to complete the statement. 

```python  
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
This statement starts a for loop that iterates over the numbers 0 through 9 and prints each number to the console.

Jane would like to verify that her code works as expected. She asks Copilot:

> *How can I run my Python file in VS Code?*

Copilot responds:
> To run your Python file, you can right-click anywhere in your file and select Run Python File in Terminal.

Jane right clicks on her Python file to display a menu. She scrolls to `Run Python - Run Python File in the Terminal` and clicks her left mouse button. 
<img src=".attachments/vscode-run-python.png" alt="vscode-run-python" width="700" />
Python runs and outputs the following in the terminal:

```console
> Hello, world!
> x is 5.
> 0
> 1
> 2
> 3
> 4
> 5
> 6
> 7
> 8
> 9
```

Jane is satisfied with the output of her code and continues to learn more about more complex datatypes in Python.

---
### Task 2: Data types in Python
Jane would like to know what data types are available in Python. She asks Copilot:
> *What are the basic datatypes in Python?*

Copilot responds:


> Python has several basic data types, including:
> 
> 1. **Integer (`int`)**: This is a whole number, positive or negative. For example: 5, -7, 1000.
> 2. **Float (`float`)**: This is a number that contains a decimal point. For example: 7.0, -8.3, 14.2.
> 3. **String (`str`)**: This is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). For example: "Hello", 'Python'.
> 4. **Boolean (`bool`)**: This is a type that can take up two values: True and False.


Jane's User Story requires lists of tasks and so she will need to develop with more complex datatypes than the above. To learn what complex datatypes are available in Python, she asks Copilot:
> *What are some complex datatypes in Python?*

Copilot responds:
> In Python, complex datatypes are data structures that can hold multiple values, possibly of different types. Here are some examples:
> 
> Lists: A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. It allows duplicate members.  
>  `my_list = [1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana"]`  
>
> Tuples: A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. It allows duplicate members.  
> `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", "banana")`  
>
> Sets: A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. It does not allow duplicate members.  
> `my_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}`  
>
> Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. It does not allow duplicate > members. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.  
> `my_dict = {"name": "Jane", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}`
> 
> Classes (Objects): Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
> ```python
> class MyClass:
>    x = 5
>```
> These complex datatypes are very useful in Python programming as they provide a way to organize and manipulate data efficiently.

Jane decides to create a list of tasks using the list datatype. She writes the following code in her `practice.py` file:

```python
tasks = ["Task 1", "Task 2", "Task 3"]
```
She then adds a print statement to display the list of tasks to the console:

```python
print(tasks)
```
Response:
> ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3']

Jane wonders how she can add, view, and remove tasks from the list. She asks Copilot:
> *How can I add, view, and remove tasks from a list in Python?*

Copilot responds:

> In Python, you can add, view, and remove tasks from a list using the following methods:
> 
> 1. Add a task to the list: You can use the `append()`` method to add a task to the end of the list.
> ```python
> tasks = []
> tasks.append('Task 4')
> ```
> 2. View tasks in the list: You can simply print the list to view all tasks. If you want to view a specific task, you can access it by its index.
> ```python
> print(tasks)  # Outputs: ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3', 'Task 4']
> print(tasks[0])  # Outputs: Task 1
> ```
>
> 3. Remove a task from the list: You can use the `remove()` method to remove a specific task by its value, or `pop()` to remove it by its index.
> ```python
> tasks.remove('Task 1')  # removes 'Task 1' from the list
> tasks.pop(0)  # removes the first task from the list
>```
>
> Remember, Python list indices start at 0, so the first task is at index 0, the second task is at index 1, and so on.

Jane accepts the suggestions and modifies her code to include the methods provided by Copilot. She adds the following methods to her `practice.py` file:

```python
# Add a task to the list
tasks.append('Task 4')

# View tasks in the list
print(tasks)  # Outputs: ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3', 'Task 4']
print(tasks[0])  # Outputs: Task 1

# Remove a task from the list
tasks.remove('Task 1')  # removes 'Task 1' from the list
print(tasks)  # Outputs: ['Task 2', 'Task 3', 'Task 4']

tasks.pop(0)  # removes the first task from the list
print(tasks)  # Outputs: ['Task 3', 'Task 4']
```

Running her Python file, Jane sees the following output in the terminal:

```console
> ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3', 'Task 4']
> Task 1
> ['Task 2', 'Task 3', 'Task 4']
> ['Task 3', 'Task 4']
```

Jane is satisfied with the output of her code and continues on to learn about classes and methods in Python.

### Task 3: Classes and Methods in Python
Jane sees that task 2 of her assigned User Story requires development of methods to add, view, and remove tasks within a project. She wants to learn how to create methods in Python so that she can complete her assigned task.

She asks Copilot:
> *How are methods created in Python?*

Copilot responds:
> In Python, methods are created within a class and are used to perform operations with the attributes of our objects. Methods are a key concept of the OOP (Object-Oriented) paradigm. They are essential to dividing responsibilities in programming, especially in large applications.
> 
> Here's a basic example of how to define a method in Python:
> 
> ```python
> class MyClass:
>     def my_method(self, parameter1, parameter2):
>         # Do something with parameter1 and parameter2
>         return result
> ```
> 
> In this example, `my_method` is a method of the class `MyClass`. The `self` parameter is a reference to the current > instance of the class and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
> 
> You can call this method from an instance of the class like this:
> 
> ```python
> my_instance = MyClass()
> result = my_instance.my_method(value1, value2)
> ```

> In this case, `value1` and `value2` are the arguments passed to `my_method`.

Jane learns from Copilot that methods need to be inside of a `class`. She writes the following code to define a class called `MyClass` inside of her `practice.py` file:

```python
class MyClass:
```
Copilot provides suggestions for completing the statement. She selects the first suggestion and presses `Enter` to complete the statement. 

```python
class MyClass :
    def my_method(self, parameter1, parameter2):
        # Do something with parameter1 and parameter2
        return result
```

She then updates the method to accept a single parameter and return a greeting message:
```python
class MyClass:
    def greet(self, name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
This method will print 'Hello, Jane!' to the console when called with the argument 'Jane'.


Jane wonders how she can use the method she just created. She asks Copilot:
> *How can I call the greet function?*

Copilot responds:
> To call the `greet` function, you first need to create an instance of `MyClass`. Then, you can call the `greet` function on this instance. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> ```python
> # Create an instance of MyClass
> my_instance = MyClass()
> 
> # Call the greet function
> greeting = my_instance.greet("Your Name")
> 
> print(greeting)  # Outputs: Hello, Your Name!
> ```

In her `practice.py` file, Jane creates a new instance of `MyClass` and calls the `greet` method with the argument "Jane". She then runs her Python file and sees the following output in the terminal:

> Hello, Jane!  


Jane is happy with the output.

Her final `practice.py` looks like this:

```python
# Task 1: Learning Relevant Python Concepts
print("Hello, world!")

x = 5

if x == 5:
    print("x is 5.")

for i in range(10):
    print(i)

# Task 2: Data types in Python
tasks = ["Task 1", "Task 2", "Task 3"]
print(tasks)

# Add a task to the list
tasks.append('Task 4')

# View tasks in the list
print(tasks)  # Outputs: ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3', 'Task 4']
print(tasks[0])  # Outputs: Task 1

# Remove a task from the list
tasks.remove('Task 1')  # removes 'Task 1' from the list
print(tasks)  # Outputs: ['Task 2', 'Task 3', 'Task 4']

tasks.pop(0)  # removes the first task from the list
print(tasks)  # Outputs: ['Task 3', 'Task 4']

# Task 3: Classes and Methods in Python
class MyClass:
    def greet(self, name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    
# Create an instance of MyClass
my_instance = MyClass()

# Call the greet function
greeting = my_instance.greet("Jane")

print(greeting)  # Outputs: Hello, Your Name!
```
