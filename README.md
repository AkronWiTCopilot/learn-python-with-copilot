# Learn Python with GitHub Copilot

## Overview

In these hands-on lab exercises, Jane Mitchell sets out to learn Python within the context of her role at "TaskMaster Pro." team. Her challenge is to implement a feature that organizes tasks by project, thus improving the app's functionality. With the interactive aid of GitHub Copilot, Jane will navigate through the process of coding in Python, documenting her code, and constructing unit tests to validate the feature's performance. This series of exercises is designed to provide a practical framework for Jane's Python education, contributing to both the project's advancement and her own development as a Python programmer.
